To run in development mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, watch for changes in your code and automatically reload the application.

To build the project for production, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `.build` directory.

To start the production server, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the server using the optimized build created in the previous step.

Remember to install the necessary dependencies before running these commands. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm i
```
